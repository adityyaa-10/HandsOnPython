# write a program in python to determine average of three numbers 

# num1 = 2
# num2 = 5
# num3 = 9

# avg = (num1 + num2 + num3)/3

# print("The average of three numbers are", avg)

# Taking user input in python 

num1 = int(input("Enter 1st number : "))
num2 = int(input("Enter 2nd number : "))
num3 = int(input("Enter 3rd number : "))

avg = (num1 + num2 + num3)/3
print("The average of three numbers are", avg)

# By default the input function takes value in string type, so we have to perfrom type casting acc to our requirements
